|Abstract | Our main question is: What are the most common crimes that occur in Los Angeles, California, and why? This question is important because the types of crimes vary, and knowing what kind of crimes are more prominent in the city, it will help people address the issue and to keep the crimes limited. To address the question, we will look into the Los Angeles crime data, which includes several different factors, such as, dates and times occurred, area of occurrence, and we plan to not only look at the occurrences but to also explore why these crimes are happening. |

|1.0 Introduction | Briefly introduce your project. (about 150 words) |
|2.0 Design Situation | *Framing Crime* Our topic is focused around the crime of a single mega-city which incorporates many aspects of society including, racism, poverty, abuse of power, and others. Here we are trying to categorize crime data based on their possible root causes to identify the biggest societal issues facing Los Angeles. *Human Values* Human values are deeply related to our issues as the issues facing the people are what leads to the crimes committed. *Stakeholders* The LA police force and the local government are the most benefitted by our project as it can lead discussions and bill creation in order to address the problems highlighted in this project. *Benefits and Harms* Without actual people to filter through this data the data can be used to commit more police resources to underprivileged areas that need financial assistance to solve the crime issues and instead would be harmed by more police presence. Although, with the categories created we can distinguish these types of crimes by need instead of violent crimes.

|3.0 Research questions | 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? See the Deign Brief, section B.4. (about 150 words) |
|4.0 The Dataset | The dataset for crimes in LA, although having only 2 files, is quite complex. From 2010 to 2019, there are more than 2 million observations and 28 features. 2020 to present day is a much smaller file as expected due to the time frame. Each observation represents a single case. The 28 attributes provide information on the record, victim, crime, location, and time. Features that will be important in our investigation includes the crime code, which indicates the severity of the crime, the area and area name and information about the victims. General information such as age, sex, and descent are presented in the data, however, no information on the offender is given. <br /> <br /> This Public Safety Data is released by the LAPD which comes with a certain credibility. We obtained the data from Kaggle, which is community based. This dataset was updated 7 months ago and uploaded by a Kaggle contributor. As this data is transcribed from the original crime reports from the LAPD, it is likely that the data collection is government funded. The data allows for crime mapping which highlights areas that are more prone to crime and this information is made available to the public in the hopes that they will make decisions to be safer. <br /> <br /> While the data may lead us to believe that it includes all crimes in Los Angeles, it only includes crimes with records in the LAPD's database. Unreported crime is potentially missing from the data and can create a large gap between the models created using this data and the real world. It is possible that victims choose to not report crimes due to various reasons and crimes such as rape often go unreported. This gap in one type of crime has the power to alter the public’s view of the world around them. Journalists or news that use this data for their statistics in their reports might be using accurate data, but the data is not necessarily an accurate representation of the population. Consumers of the articles could potentially be indirectly impacted by this data. Another important aspect of visualizing crime rates is the ratio between crime and population density in an area. Without context, areas may seem safe or unsafe just based on simple visualizations such as a basic crime map. Although it provides certain useful information, it is not all there is to it. |
