|Abstract | Our main question is: What are the most common crimes that occur in Los Angeles, California, and why? This question is important because the types of crimes vary, and knowing what kind of crimes are more prominent in the city, it will help people address the issue and to keep the crimes limited. To address the question, we will look into the Los Angeles crime data, which includes several different factors, such as, dates and times occurred, area of occurrence, and we plan to not only look at the occurrences but to also explore why these crimes are happening. |

|1.0 Introduction | Briefly introduce your project. (about 150 words) |
|2.0 Design Situation | *Framing Crime* Our topic is focused around the crime of a single mega-city which incorporates many aspects of society including, racism, poverty, abuse of power, and others. Here we are trying to categorize crime data based on their possible root causes to identify the biggest societal issues facing Los Angeles. *Human Values* Human values are deeply related to our issues as the issues facing the people are what leads to the crimes committed. *Stakeholders* The LA police force and the local government are the most benefitted by our project as it can lead discussions and bill creation in order to address the problems highlighted in this project. *Benefits and Harms* Without actual people to filter through this data the data can be used to commit more police resources to underprivileged areas that need financial assistance to solve the crime issues and instead would be harmed by more police presence. Although, with the categories created we can distinguish these types of crimes by need instead of violent crimes.
